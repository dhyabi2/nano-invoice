"""Invoices that bind a Nano payment to the order it pays for.

Nano blocks carry no memo, so the binding is a UNIQUE TAGGED AMOUNT:

    pay_raw = amount_raw + tag

amount_raw must be a multiple of TAG_MODULUS (10**6 raw), so the lowest six raw
digits of pay_raw are exactly the tag. A tag is unique among the merchant's open
invoices and is not reused for TAG_QUARANTINE_S after its invoice closes, so a
late payment for an old invoice cannot settle a new one. A tag is below 10**6
raw, i.e. under 1e-24 XNO: economically nothing.

Non-custodial: this module reads the public ledger, never holds a key and never
sends. Refunds come out as instructions for the merchant's own wallet.
